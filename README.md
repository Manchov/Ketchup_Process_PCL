# Ketchup Production Process

This repository contains all the necessary files and documentation for the Ketchup Production Process project, as explored and described by Marko Manchov from the Faculty of Information Sciences and Computer Engineering at "St. Cyril and Methodius" University in Skopje, North Macedonia.

## Overview

The project aims to describe the process of making ketchup/tomato sauce, providing a detailed analysis of the entire production process from historical evolution to modern-day execution with advanced technology and computer systems. The standard recipe from Heinz is used as a baseline for the production process, though variations exist worldwide.

## Contents

- `Backup/AutoSave/`: Folder containing autosaved files for the process.
- `151211_S10.pdf`: Documentation detailing the ketchup production process.
- `Ketchup_process.*`: Various files, including diagrams (`.dlo`), model definitions (`.dmd`), workspace information (`.wsp`), and exports (`.csv`, `.txt`).
- `ketchup_process.png`: Image file depicting the process flow.
- `Процес на производство на кечап.pptx`: A PowerPoint presentation outlining the ketchup production process.

## Installation

No installation is required to view the documentation and files. However, to interact with the diagrams and models, the corresponding software that can open `.dlo`, `.dmd`, and `.wsp` file types is necessary.

## Usage

To understand the ketchup production process, start with `151211_S10.pdf` and then refer to the corresponding diagrams and models. The PowerPoint presentation offers a visual introduction to the project.

To view and interact with the process diagrams and models, you will need the Do-more Designer software, which can open `.dlo`, `.dmd`, and `.wsp` file types.

1. Download the Do-more Designer software from [Automation Direct](https://www.automationdirect.com/do-more/brx/software).
2. Install the software following the provided instructions on their website.
3. Open the `Ketchup_process.dmd`, `Ketchup_process.wsp`, or any other related files with the Do-more Designer software to explore the ketchup production process in detail.
